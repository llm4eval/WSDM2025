## Overview
The first workshop on evaluating IR systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) is accepting submissions that describe original research findings, preliminary research results, proposals for new work, and recent relevant studies already published in high-quality venues. 
<!-- The workshop will have both an in-person and virtual component, and submissions are welcome even for researchers who cannot attend in person, as they will present their work in the virtual component. -->

## Topics of interest
We welcome both __full papers__ and __extended abstract__ submissions on the following topics, including but not limited to:

- LLM-based evaluation metrics for traditional IR and generative IR.
- Agreement between human and LLM labels.
- Effectiveness and/or efficiency of LLMs to produce robust relevance labels.
- Investigating LLM-based relevance estimators for potential systemic biases.
- Automated evaluation of text generation systems.
- End-to-end evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation systems.
- Trustworthiness in the world of LLMs evaluation.
- Prompt engineering in LLMs evaluation.
- Effectiveness and/or efficiency of LLMs as ranking models.
- LLMs in specific IR tasks such as personalized search, conversational search, and multimodal retrieval.
- Challenges and future directions in LLM-based IR evaluation.

## Submission guidelines
We welcome the following submissions:

- __Previously unpublished manuscripts__ will be accepted as extended abstracts and full papers (any length between 1 - 9 pages) with unlimited references, formatted according to the latest ACM SIG proceedings template available at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. 
- __Published manuscripts__ can be submitted in their original format.

All submissions should be made through Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=llm4evalwsdm25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=llm4evalwsdm25){:target="_blank"}

All papers will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop, especially to the main themes identified above, and their potential to generate discussion. For already published studies, the paper can be submitted in the original format. These submissions will be reviewed for their relevance to this workshop. All submissions must be in English (PDF format).

<!-- Please note the workshop will have an __in-person__ (to be held with SIGIR 2024) and __virtual__ component (to be held at a later date on SIGIR VF). During submission, the authors should select their preferred component. -->
All accepted papers will have a poster presentation with a few selected for spotlight talks. Accepted papers may be uploaded to arXiv.org, allowing submission elsewhere as they will be considered non-archival. The workshop's website will maintain a link to the arXiv versions of the papers.
