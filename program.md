__Abstract.__ In this talk, I will discuss recent advancements in the application of large language models (LLMs) to ranking, rating, and reward modeling, particularly in the context of information retrieval tasks. I will emphasize the fundamental similarities among these problems, highlighting that they essentially address the same underlying issue but through different approaches. Based on this observation, I propose several research questions that offer promising avenues for future exploration.
